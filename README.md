![](https://github.com/dpbac/basics-web-scraping/blob/master/images/bond_webscraping.JPG)

In this project/tutorial we introduce the basics of `web scraping`. This technique allows us retrieving data from websites which can be very handy specially when there are no datasets available or/and it is not possible to obtain such data via APIs.

In our example it is possible to see how to obtain data from different websites having a basic knowledge on HTML and using some Python, and Python packages 

## Tools

* [`request`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/): HTTP library for Python that allows us to send HTTP requests in a simple way.

* [`Beautiful Soup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/): Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It allows us to access easily
the information we need to retrieve.

Some knowledge on lists, list comprehension, and string methods are also very helpful.

## Install requirements
* Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  * Make sure you use Python 3.
  * You may want to use a virtual environment for this.
