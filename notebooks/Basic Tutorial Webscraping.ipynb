    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As William Edwards Deming said \"In God we trust; all others bring data.\", so bring us data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When data is not available through datasets or APIs, `web scraping` may be our last resource. It allows retrieving and parsing data stored on web pages across the Internet. It not only allows us to retrieve data when we don't have it but also give us the opportunity to acquire additional data that might give that extra boost to our model. Therefore, obtaining data through `web scraping` is a valuable skill for any data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a **business point of view**, web scraping helps us make informed business decisions. It provides an opportunity to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Know better our competitors, their prices, services,\n",
    "* Know our customers, their behavior, their needs, what they think of product(s)/service(s),\n",
    "* Stay well informed about partners,\n",
    "* Gather public opinion about a company in general, as well as of its or similar product(s)/service(s),\n",
    "* Obtain contact or other information of potential clients via social media and forums, so meaningfully resources can be directed towards this group of possible customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "and the list goes on‚Ä¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for **public/governmental organizations** web scraping can be very helpful. It might help gathering information from websites of different cities within a region about an important subject such as health, security, or environment. This data that sometimes are not easily collected across city agencies might be published by them online. Therefore, this gives an opportunity to collect and analyze the data in order to extract beneficial insights to society.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, data obtained via web scraping can be used for **personal purposes** and for fun! For instances, it can help you find your new home, a new recipe, material for your hobby, or information about your favorite subject, artist, movie, music‚Ä¶. again, imagination is the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then after scraping your data, it is time to analyze and manipulate it using tools such as `pandas` and `NumPy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, to illustrate the use of web scraping we've chosen a subject that probably will please everybody (or most of you): Movies and Music! On top of it we will be an opportunity to pay our respect to the first James Bond, [Sir Thomas Sean Connery](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/bio) that left us October 31, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to collect information about movies of the James Bond franchise and their theme songs. For this, the following steps are taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "üìΩÔ∏è Extract information about all the movies from James Bond from a table at [List_of_James_Bond_films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_films).\n",
    "\n",
    "üé∂ Extract information about all the James Bond's theme songs from a table at [Lijst_van_titelsongs_uit_de_James_Bondfilms](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lijst_van_titelsongs_uit_de_James_Bondfilms) (\"Yes! Dutch site because the structure of the table was much easier. It does not need to be difficult to be good, right? üòâ \").\n",
    "\n",
    "üé∂ Scrape lyrics of the theme songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this what we need is a basic knowledge on HTML which means its tree structure and that tags define the branches where the information we search are. Furthermore, we make use of two Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) which we allow us to get the webpage we want; and\n",
    "* [`Beautiful Soup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) that parses the content of the webpage and allows us extracting tags from an HTML document.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Inspecting website\n",
    "\n",
    "An important step when web scraping is **inspection**. Every time we scrape a website we need to have an idea of its structure and where to find what we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, no matter which browser we use, we can access its code by right clicking and choosing to access it source code, i.e., `view page` (Firefox) or `view page source` (Chrome and Microsoft Edge). If you need details of an specific element right click on it and choose `inspect element`(Firefox) or `inspect` (Chrome and Microsoft Edge), instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web pages use `HyperText Markup Language (HTML)` which is a markup language with its own syntax and rules. When a web browser like Chrome or Firefox downloads a web page, it reads the HTML to determine how to render and display it to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML consists of **tags**. Anything in between the opening and closing of a tag is the content of that tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of elements that often encountered are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<head>` : Contains metadata useful to the web browser which is rendering the page but which is invisible to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<body>` : Contains the content of an HTML document with which the user interacts. Every page has only one body.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<div>`: Section of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<p>`: Delimits paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<a>` : Creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more definitions of elements check these links: [dev_mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) or [w3s](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "While inspecting the website source code you will notice that some tags contain attributes which provide special instructions for the contents contained within that tag. Specific html attributes names are followed by equal sign, followed by information which is passed to that attribute within that tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<div id=\"contentSub\"></div>`"

      " In 1961 the producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman joined forces to purchase the filming rights to Fleming's novels.[3] They founded the production company Eon Productions and, with financial backing by United Artists, began working on Dr. No, which was directed by Terence Young and featured Connery as Bond.[4] Following Dr. No's release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company Danjaq to ensure future productions in the James Bond film series.[5] The series currently encompasses twenty-four films, with the most recent, Spectre, released in October 2015. With a combined gross of nearly $7¬†billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the fourth-highest-grossing film series, behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars and Wizarding World films.[6] Accounting for the effects of inflation, the Bond films have amassed over $14¬†billion at current prices.[a] The films have won five Academy Awards: for Sound Effects (now Sound Editing) in Goldfinger (at the 37th Awards), to John Stears for Special Visual Effects in Thunderball (at the 38th Awards), to Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers for Sound Editing, to Adele and Paul Epworth for Original Song in Skyfall (at the 85th Awards) and to Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for Original Song in Spectre (at the 88th Awards).
